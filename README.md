# Request For Change Updater
A specific programme written for a colleague of mine â€“ to update a spreadsheet with data from word files (request for changes). It provides a front-end to select Word documents and and excel file to update.

The program will traverse the word files for data the excel file needs, then it will open the excel file, filling in the appropriate data in the right places automatically.
